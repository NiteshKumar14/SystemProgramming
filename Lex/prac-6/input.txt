To form a star like our Sun, which is 864,400 miles (1,391,000 kilometres) across, it would take a collection of gas and dust a hundred times the size of our solar system. This is just the beginning. Once such a large amount of gas and dust huddle together, they form what we call a protostar. An object is considered a protostar for as long as material is still falling inward. For our Sun, and stars of the same mass, the protostar phase would have ended after approximately 100,000 years. After this, the protostar stops growing and the disk of material surrounding it is destroyed by radiation.
If the protostar was unsuccessful in acquiring enough mass, a brown dwarf will come into shape. These poor little guys are substellar objects that are unable to sustain hydrogen fusion reactions in their cores, due to their insufficient mass. Main sequence stars have no issue with this, to the envy of brown dwarfs. Putting it simply, a brown dwarf is too big to be called a planet, and too small to be called a star. Until 1995, they were only a theoretical concept. It is now thought, however, that there is a brown dwarf for every six stars.
The fault in our stars.
